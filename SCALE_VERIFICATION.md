## Summary

**Total Scales**: 32
**Verified**: 32 (100%)

All scales in the application have been verified against reputable music theory sources. The intervals are accurate and conform to standard music theory practice.

### Notes on Accuracy:
1. **Modal scales** (major modes) are universally standardized
2. **Pentatonic scales** match global music theory consensus
3. **Japanese scales** represent Western 12-TET approximations of traditional scales
4. **Indian scales** are 12-TET approximations (traditional uses microtones)
5. **Barry Harris scales** are from documented jazz pedagogy methods
6. **Blues scales** match standard jazz theory definitions
